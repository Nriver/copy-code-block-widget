# Why I Made This?

There is no copy button in Trilium due to the upstream CKEditor's lack of this feature. The related issue https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9774 has not been touched for 3 years until now. I would assume this won't be fixed in the upstream. So, I made an implementation by myself.
